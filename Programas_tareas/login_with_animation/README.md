# 🐻 Login with Bear Animation (Rive + Flutter) 🐻

## 🧩 Brief Description of the Functionality

This project features an **animated login screen** built with **Flutter** and **Rive**, where a friendly bear reacts dynamically to the user’s actions.  

🎯 The main goal is to demonstrate how to combine **real-time animations** with logic using **Rive State Machines** in Flutter.

### 💡 The bear can:

- 🙈 Cover its eyes while you type your password  
- 👀 Look around while you type your email  
- 😄 Smile when the credentials are correct  
- 😢 Look sad when the credentials are invalid

## 🧩 What is Rive and Why Use It?  

**Rive** is a design and animation tool that lets you create interactive vector animations controlled directly from your app’s code.  

Its State Machine defines how animations change — for example, when the bear covers its eyes, becomes happy, or turns sad.  

🌀 This approach makes the interface feel **alive**, turning simple login screens into engaging experiences.
